    "- building category constructors which create instances of such doctrines.\n",

    "We use the term **doctrine** in a loose sense to describe categories with specified additional properties or structures, e.g., additive, Abelian, monoidal, or closed monoidal categories, etc.\n",

    "A **category constructor**, as the name suggests, is a procedure which outputs a category as a\n",

    "A **doctrine-based** category constructor takes as input one or several categories $C_1 , . . . , C_n$ of\n",
    "specific doctrines $D_1 , \\dots , D_n$ and outputs a category $A$ as a particular instance of a specific\n",
    "doctrine $D$ according to the two following rules:\n",
    "The constructor\n",
    "- specifies the data structure of the objects and morphisms in $A$ in terms of objects and\n",
    "morphisms of the input categories;\n",
    "- expresses all defining categorical operations of the doctrine $D$ (of its output category)\n",
    "as algorithms written in terms of the categorical operations supported by the doctrines\n",
    "$D_1,\\dots,D_n$ (of its input categories).\n",

    "For example, the category constructor *`AdditiveClosure`* takes as input a preadditive category\n",
    "$C$ and returns the additive closure category $C^{\\oplus}$ , along with an embedding of $C$ in $C^{\\oplus}$ which is universal among all additive functors from $C$ into an additive category. Another example\n",

    "We refer to category constructors that are not doctrine-based as **primitive** category constructors. For example, the constructor *`FreeCategory`* takes as input a quiver $q$ and outputs the free category $\\mathcal{F}_q$ defined by $q$. Another example is the category constructor *`RingAsCategory`* which takes as input a ring $R$ and outputs the preadditive category $\\mathcal{C}(R)$ consisting of a single object, say $âˆ—$, whose endomorphisms are the elements of $R$.\n",

    "more primitive category constructors on one or more data structures (e.g., sets, rings, quivers,\n",
